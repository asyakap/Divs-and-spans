    <p>Week 1</p>
    <p>On week 1, we learned basic concepts of <span class="emphasize">HTML and CSS</span>. I liked the material, it was easy to follow. I created several new web pages and styled them with CSS. The only thing I struggled with was an amount of the material. I was not always able to finish daily lessons within the day.</p>
    <p>Week 2</p>
    <p>to be continued...</p>
